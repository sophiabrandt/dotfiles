> dev setup with st, tmux, fish, NeoVim, etc.

## OS

- Manjaro Linux (Arch-derived distro), [i3 Community edition](https://manjaro.org/download/i3/)

The i3 config is pretty much vanilla Manjaro i3 except some keybindings for [Colemak](https://colemak.com/) and some programs which I wanted to run at startup.

## Terminal

- [st](https://st.suckless.org/) with tmux wrapper (sterminal, a wrapper for st-manjaro and tmux)
- [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) with [oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish) and [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher)

## Editor

- [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/)

## Look

- color scheme: [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)
- font: [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)/[Fura Code Nerd Font Mono](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) _(note: st and tmux can't display font ligatures)_
