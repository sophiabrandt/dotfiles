## OS

- Manjaro Linux (Arch-derived distro), [i3 Community edition](https://manjaro.org/download/i3/)

The i3 config is pretty much vanilla Manjaro i3 except some keybindings for [Colemak](https://colemak.com/) and some programs which I wanted to run at startup.

## Terminal

- [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/#)
- [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) with [oh-my-fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish) and [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher)

## Editor

- [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/)

## Look

- color scheme: [Nord](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-vim)
